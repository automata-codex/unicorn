`judgeVerdictSchema` is `{passed, rationale}` and always has been. A row schema drafted for this milestone listed `judgeConfidence?: number` as a field a rubric could conditionally emit, but no rubric does, because self-reported LLM confidence was rejected earlier in this project's design. That decision predates the multi-run harness and was never written down anywhere except the shape of `judgeVerdictSchema` — recorded here because the new score row was the first place a reviewer might reasonably ask "where's the confidence column," and the honest answer is that a permanently-empty optional field reads as an invitation to fill it, not as a decision. JSONL rows are append-friendly, so if a rubric ever does emit one, adding the field later is non-breaking — old rows simply lack it.
