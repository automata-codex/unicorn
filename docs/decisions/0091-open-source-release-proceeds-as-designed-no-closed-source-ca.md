title: Open-source release proceeds as designed; no closed-source carve-out for prompts or graph orchestration
area: licensing-business
status: accepted
superseded_by: null
milestone: unknown
summary: >-
  Rejects closing the Warden prompts or any future orchestration logic as a moat, on
  threat-model grounds rather than technical ones — the time-to-market estimate shows
  a prompt-only closure would not buy the gap it is meant to. Names where protection
  actually sits, and closes the open-source release question.

Considered and rejected: closing the Warden prompts, and/or any future LangGraph-style orchestration logic, as a competitive moat against a funded competitor forking the public repo.

Rejected on threat-model grounds, not technical ones. The TTRPG tooling space doesn't attract funded competition at this scale — campaign/worldbuilding tools have ~3 players with no direct head-to-head competition (e.g. Dungeon Scrawl), VTTs consolidate rather than multiply despite looking easy to enter, and the hobby's active resistance to AI shrinks the addressable market in a way that makes it a poor target for outside funding in the first place. A funded competitor materializing at all is judged unlikely.

Even granting a funded competitor with 3 FTEs, estimated time-to-market with full repo access (architecture, schemas, tool definitions, oracle table structure, and prompts) is ~4-7 months to reach current parity, versus ~7-11 months reverse-engineering from the live app alone — a gap of roughly 2-4 months. That gap is smaller than a plausible solo-dev hiatus and is mostly attributable to the architecture/schema decisions in this log, not the prompt text specifically — so a prompt-only closure wouldn't meaningfully close it anyway, and closing the architecture layer instead would break the self-hosted config-only story (`AUTH_PROVIDER`, `REALTIME_PROVIDER`, etc.) that depends on that layer staying legible.

Real protection against a funded competitor, if one ever appears, is shipping velocity and the eval harness / fixture corpus / failure-mode taxonomy — accumulated evidence that isn't copyable by reading code — plus per-user `campaign_canon` accumulation as a retention moat. These require no licensing decision and are being built regardless.

ELv2 remains the license for the reasons already in this log (managed-service restriction, consistency with other Automata Codex projects) — not as competitive protection, since it offers no real recourse against a "probably but not provably" copy in any case.

This closes the "open-source release decision" previously flagged as unresolved. Public repo, self-hosted-first build sequence, and M9 milestone scope (Docker Compose production config, self-hosted setup guide, DigitalOcean walkthrough) all stand as currently planned.
