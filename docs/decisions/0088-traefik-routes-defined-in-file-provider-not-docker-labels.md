title: Traefik routes defined in file provider, not Docker labels

Traefik routes for `app.zoltar.local` and `api.zoltar.local` are defined as file-based dynamic config (`infra/traefik/dynamic/host-routes.yml`) rather than as Docker labels on the `backend` and `frontend` compose services. Docker labels only exist on running containers — in Workflow B (the daily development loop), those containers aren't running, so label-based routes produce a 404. File-based routes pointing to `host.docker.internal` work in both workflows: in Workflow B the apps run directly on the host, and in Workflow A Docker publishes container ports to the host. One routing mechanism covers both cases.
