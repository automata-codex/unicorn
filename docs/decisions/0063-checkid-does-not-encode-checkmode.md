title: "`checkId` does not encode `checkMode`"

A check's `id` (`out-of-order-resolution`, `hidden-info-leak`) is the failure-mode tag in lower-kebab, deliberately never including `structural`/`judged`. `UNSURFACED-CHECK` has already migrated modes once in this repo — its regex-based structural classifier missed a stakes-gating roll phrased as a question ("Does anything react to Alvarez moving...") rather than using a fixed keyword, so it moved to a judge call after a real-run false pass. `eval:compare` pairs history on `(fixtureId, checkId)`; if the id encoded mode, that migration would have silently un-paired every historical comparison for the check the moment it moved. `checkMode` stays its own column on the score row instead, so a check can migrate modes without breaking the very comparisons that would tell you whether the migration helped.
