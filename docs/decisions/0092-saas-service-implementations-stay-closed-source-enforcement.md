title: SaaS service implementations stay closed source — enforcement rationale, not competitive secrecy
area: licensing-business

summary: >-
  Why the SaaS service implementations stay closed while the prompts and orchestration
  stay open. Not secrecy — the RLS, tenancy and billing layer is the literal mechanism
  that makes the ELv2 single-tenant restriction real, and the open core is
  single-tenant by omission rather than enforcement. Costs nothing to maintain, since
  the interface split already separates them.

Unlike the Warden prompts and any future graph orchestration logic, the concrete SaaS implementations of the service interfaces (`ClerkAuthService`, `StripeEntitlementsService`, `AblyRealtimeService`, the RLS migration scripts and tenant-aware middleware, etc.) remain closed source when built. This is a different rationale from the open-source decision above and should not be read as contradicting it.

These implementations carry little competitive-secrecy value on their own — they are mostly integration glue against third-party APIs (Stripe, Clerk, Ably) that a competent engineer could reproduce in days regardless of prior access. The moat reasoning that justified keeping the Warden prompts and graph open does not argue for closing these; there was never much moat value here to protect.

The reason to keep them closed is that they are the literal technical mechanism that makes the ELv2 single-tenant restriction real. The open core is single-tenant by omission, not by enforcement — no RLS policies, no tenant-aware query layer, no `org_id` isolation, no billing wiring. If the multi-tenant RLS migrations and Stripe billing logic were included in the public repo, anyone would have the missing piece needed to stand up a competing managed service on top of Zoltar's own code — precisely the outcome the ELv2 restriction exists to prevent, and a more concrete risk than a competitor reading a prompt file.

This costs nothing to maintain, unlike a prompt/graph closed-source boundary would have: self-hosted already runs on structurally different implementations (Noop and local defaults per the service-interface table), so there is no shared artifact to split or distribution boundary to police. It is closed by the natural shape of the interface/implementation split, not by extra engineering effort spent defending it.
