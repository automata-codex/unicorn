These are two different things that were originally both called `adventure_log`. They serve different purposes and must not be conflated. `adventure_telemetry` is infrastructure-level diagnostic telemetry — one row per turn in a DB table, containing the full `submit_gm_response` payload, all `roll_dice` calls with purpose annotations and results, the state snapshot sent to Claude, and prompt/completion token counts. It exists to diagnose pipeline bugs and is not player-facing. The session export is the player-facing portable format — a single JSON file containing the message log (with turn numbers and timestamps), canon log, turn-level state deltas, final state snapshot, and GM context. It supports session restore and post-session analysis. It is produced on demand, not written per-turn to a DB table. Mixing these concerns into a single artifact would make `game_events` harder to query for its application-level purpose and would conflate player-facing data portability with internal diagnostic tooling.
